# closp

A Leiningen template for a full featured web framework (whatever that means)

## Usage

Until the first version in clojars appears follow this:

1. Clone this project
2. Run `lein install` in the project folder
3. Run `lein new closp _projectname_ -n _your.ns.here_` in a different folder
4. Run `lein ragtime migrate` in the newly created project (This will add an admin user with username: 
_admin@localhost.de_ and password: _admin_ to a new database)



## Features
* H2 database on filesystem as a default
* Ragtime for database migrations
