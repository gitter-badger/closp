# closp

A Leiningen template for a full featured web framework.
  
See it live at: http://sveri.de:3124  
Username: admin@localhost.de  
Password: admin  

## Goals
* Provide a full stack to get started with
* Provide generated code which can be changed easily
* Provide an opiniated predefined set of libraries
* 

## Usage

1. Run `lein new closp _projectname_ -n foo.bar` in a different folder
2. Run `lein ragtime migrate` in the newly created project (This will add an admin user with username: 
_admin@localhost.de_ and password: _admin_ to a new database)
3. Run `lein cljx once` to compile the cljx files
4. Run `lein repl` and then `(start-dev-system)` to run the application in dev mode. 
This will also compile the clojurescript.
5. Run `lein rel-jar` to generate a runnable jar file.

## Docker

There is a dockerfile attached which will fetch the latest version and run an example project.

## Configuration

There is a closp.edn file in the resources f

## Authentication and Authorization

We use the buddy (<https://github.com/funcool/buddy>) library for this.  
Configuration is done in _ns.service.auth_  
There is a concept of roles, _admin_ and _none_ are alreaded provided, you can add more in the auth namespace.
Or, create a database storage for this.  
Next you can find a _rules_ def in the _auth_ namespace which defines the access rules for every available link. For
more information please look at the buddy documentation.

## Database Layer

Closp uses jdbc to connect to a database (<https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc>). This is 

## FAQ
### I get this warning: Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: _registerComponent(...): Target container is not a DOM element.

This will happen only in dev mode for every page where you did not explicitly register your clojurescript with.
Look at dev.cljs for this line `:jsload-callback (fn [] (core/main))` and change the call to `(core/main)` how you
need it for the page you are working on right now.
