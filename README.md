# closp

A Leiningen template for a full featured web framework (whatever that means)

## Usage

Until the first version in clojars appears follow this:

1. Clone this project
2. Run `lein install` in the project folder
3. Run `lein new closp _projectname_ -n _your.ns.here_` in a different folder
4. Run `lein ragtime migrate` in the newly created project (This will add an admin user with username: 
_admin@localhost.de_ and password: _admin_ to a new database)
5. Run `lein cljx once` to compile the cljx files
6. Run `lein repl` and the `(start-server)` to run the application in dev mode. This will also compile the clojurescript.
7. Run `lein rel-jar` to generate a runnable jar file.
